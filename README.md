# smell-sequence
Human-driven AI perfume generation, on the fly.
**VERY DEMO**
Not on the web anywhere. 

If you want to run this locally, you can run `npm run dev` in the frontend directory and `flask --app main.py --debug run
` from the backend directory. Currently, the frontend is hardcoded to send requests to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

Please don't use this to automate away perfumery jobs <3
