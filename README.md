# smell-sequence
Human-driven AI perfume generation, on the fly.

**VERY DEMO**

The demo isn't on the web yet, so you'll have to run locally:
* Run `npm run dev` in the frontend directory.
* Run `flask --app main.py --debug run` from the backend directory.

Currently, the frontend is hardcoded to send requests to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. This is in `frontend/src/App.vue`

Please don't use this to automate perfumery jobs <3
